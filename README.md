# 🦀 Rust-lt3S  
**Rust Long-Term Secure & Sustainable Support**

> “Preserving the stability of Rust — for decades.”

---

### 🌍 Overview
**Rust-lt3S** (Long-Term Secure & Sustainable Support) is an initiative of the [R3C Foundation](https://github.com/r3c-foundation),  
focused on maintaining a **frozen, reproducible, and secure Rust toolchain** for industrial and embedded systems.  

This repository provides **long-term stability**, **offline reproducibility**, and **compiler independence**  
to ensure Rust’s sustainability across the next decades.

### 🧱 Core Principles
| Principle | Description |
|:--|:--|
| **Long-Term** | Maintainable over 10+ years — independent of upstream volatility. |
| **Secure** | Reproducible builds with cryptographic verification (SHA256 / GPG). |
| **Sustainable** | Designed for energy-efficient builds and ecosystem longevity. |

### 🔧 Architecture

rust-lt3s/ ├─ toolchain/      # Frozen rustc + cargo binaries ├─ manifest/       # LTSS manifest & checksums ├─ ci/             # Automated build + integrity pipelines └─ docs/           # Technical specs and version policy

---

### 🚀 Roadmap
- [ ] Integrate CI/CD 3-OS (Ubuntu / macOS / Windows)
- [ ] Provide frozen Rust 1.70.x builds
- [ ] Add binary signature + checksum verification
- [ ] Publish LTSS manifest (JSON + Markdown)
- [ ] Integrate with `R3C-nightly-ltss` automation
