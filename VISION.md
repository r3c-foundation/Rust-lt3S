# 🌍 Rust-lt3S Vision

### “Long-Term Secure and Sustainable Rust”

Rust-lt3S is the long-term support and preservation layer for Rust ecosystems —  
a frozen, auditable, and secure toolchain intended to outlive upstream volatility.

---

### 🎯 Mission
- Preserve **Rust 1.70.x** and compatible toolchains for 10+ years.  
- Ensure deterministic builds with **verified binary integrity**.  
- Maintain **embedded and industrial-grade** stability beyond upstream support timelines.  

---

### 💡 Philosophy
| Principle | Explanation |
|:--|:--|
| **Longevity** | Software should remain buildable and trustworthy for decades. |
| **Sovereignty** | Developers must own their toolchains — not depend on central authorities. |
| **Transparency** | Every byte should be verifiable, traceable, and reproducible. |

---

### 🔮 Future Vision
By 2030+, Rust-lt3S aims to:
- Serve as the **base LTSS Rust toolchain** for the R3C Ecosystem.
- Enable **offline-certified builds** for Rust-based embedded platforms.
- Prove that open toolchains can achieve **industrial LTSS-class** reliability.
